6-The next step is to assign the size of the virtual hard disk. You can safely work with 20 GB size for hard disk. There are two options for creating a virtual hard disk.  
i choose to split the disk into multiple files. The advantage of splitting is if you want to copy the hard disk file to another computer, you can easily copy the files.
